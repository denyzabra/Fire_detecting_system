# Fire_detecting_system
This repository contains the code and circuit design files for a fire detecting system built using Arduino. The system utilizes a flame sensor, buzzer, and temperature sensor to detect the presence of fire and monitor the ambient temperature

Key Features:

Flame Sensor: The flame sensor module detects the presence of flames in the environment.
Buzzer: When a fire is detected, the buzzer is activated to provide an audible alarm.
Temperature Sensor: The system also monitors the ambient temperature and alerts if it exceeds a predefined threshold.
Arduino Board: The Arduino board serves as the central control unit for the system.
The provided Arduino code can be uploaded to the Arduino board to enable the fire detection and temperature monitoring functionality. The circuit design files illustrate the connections between the Arduino board, flame sensor, buzzer, and temperature sensor.

This fire detecting system offers an early warning system for potential fire incidents, providing enhanced safety measures for homes, offices, and other environments. The open-source nature of this project encourages further customization and improvements to meet specific requirements.

Feel free to explore the code and circuit design files, adapt them to your needs, and contribute to the project's development.
detected.

Monitor the ambient temperature displayed in the Serial Monitor. If it exceeds the predefined threshold, the Serial Monitor will display "High temperature detected!"

Customize the threshold values in the code to match your specific requirements, based on sensor characteristics and environmental conditions.

Feel free to adapt and modify the code and circuit design files to suit your needs. Contributions to this project are welcome!
